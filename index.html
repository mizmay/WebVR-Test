      <h1>Welcome to AAG Seattle VR Tours</h1>
      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>This is a volunteer effort to replicate some of the in-person elements of the 2021 AAG Annual Meeting. Specifically we are trying to emulate field trips that allow us to get more familiar with the place where the meeting is held.</p>
      <p>These tours were made as proof of concepts, using an existing in-person tour and an active research project to present places in Seattle with current and historic significance. Besides getting to see some of Seattle, these tours present a novel way to encounter place-based content using accessible virtual reality, 360 images, and web tools.</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>In the summer of 2020, there was a resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in response to multiple accounts of police brutality against Black folks in the USA, and the overt structural inequalities along racial lines, exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Seattle, protesters took to the streets and were met with police using tear gas, flashbangs and pepper spray to disperse the crowds (<a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/What-is-CHOP-the-zone-in-Seattle-formed-by-15341281.php">Savransky, 2020</a>). Protesters marched from Downtown, east towards Capitol Hill on June 1st (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/activists-take-over-a-seattle-neighborhood-banishing-the-police/2020/06/11/7172e1e6-ac24-11ea-a9d9-a81c1a491c52_story.html">Scruggs, 2020</a>). They found their way blocked by barricades around Seattle Police Department’s (SPD) East Precinct. The crowd became so large that the police declared a riot, and a tense seven-day standoff ensued with protesters who returned daily (ibid). On June 8th, in an attempt to de-escalate the violence, the police vacated the East Precinct. Protesters repurposed the barriers, which previously protected the East Precinct, to form the borders of an autonomous, police-free zone, pedestrianizing a six-block area and ensuring the police could not easily return.</p>
        <p>This tour leads viewers through some of the key landmarks in the protest, and documentation of scenes during the event. [Instructions for navigating the tour, below this window]</p></p>
