      <h1>Welcome to AAG Seattle VR Tours</h1>
      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>This is a volunteer effort to replicate some of the in-person elements of the 2021 AAG Annual Meeting. Specifically we are trying to emulate field trips that allow us to get more familiar with the place where the meeting is held.</p>
      <p>These tours were made as proof of concepts, using an existing in-person tour and an active research project to present places in Seattle with current and historic significance. Besides getting to see some of Seattle, these tours present a novel way to encounter place-based content using accessible virtual reality, 360 images, and web tools.</p>
