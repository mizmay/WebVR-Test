# Virtual Tour 360 Photos

This collection of files powers a simple demo of 360 photos for incorporation into VR tours for AAG 2021 in Seattle, WA. View the 360 photos at: [https://mizmay.github.io/WebVR-Test/](https://mizmay.github.io/WebVR-Test/)

The goal is to combine this content with narrative to create [something like this](http://blogs.ubc.ca/alpineplants/virtual-field-trips/dakota-bowl-forest/).

Additional steps are required to pull 1-4 of these images into a narrative, e.g. narrative, wayfinder map(s).

----

This simple example of web VR uses the [A-Frame Web VR framework](https://aframe.io/).
